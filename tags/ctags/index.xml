You can&amp;rsquo;t do it with sumneko and other language servers for lua.
The instruction of how is below.
Introduction and lua I&amp;rsquo;d like to share the one trick for neovim programming.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve found out that you can rewrite (almost) all your neovim scripting code to lua language.
And it turns out to be the smallest and simplest language possible.</description></item><item><title>vim ijump command</title><link>https://snyssfx.github.io/posts/vim-fast-vertical-moves/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 18:59:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://snyssfx.github.io/posts/vim-fast-vertical-moves/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve read a great article about moving around files in vim. The author says you could move between files faster with using :edit and :find commands. Also for :find one you should set include option or includeexpr func when imports of language are rather different from usual project structure.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think the :find command is useful for Go programming since you should include $HOME/pkg/mod in path, and file searching become pretty slow at this point.</description></item></channel></rss>
