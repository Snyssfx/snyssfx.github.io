Here I am working in a team as a Go backend engineer.</p><p>My background is in computer science, I did my undergrad at Saint-Petersburg State University.
I did my <a href=https://research.jetbrains.org/ru-ru/groups/ml_methods/seminars/120/>thesis</a> with <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/>JetBrains</a> lab of AI tools for IntelliJ IDEA,
and at the same time, I worked in a few part-time jobs-startups.</p><p>After the university, I wanted to develop highly distributed systems and joined a game <a href=https://panoramikgames.com/>company</a> as a Python engineer.
I learned a lot about large scale systems, the infrastructure around them,
and played an important role in scaling core projects with increased business needs.</p><p>This work showed me that I want to grow professionally as an infrastructure engineer and I need to move to a bigger company.
Also because more infrastructure systems are written in Go and not Python, I changed the stack and was recruited to <a href=https://ozon.ru>ozon.ru</a>.
It&rsquo;s an E-commerce online shop where we as a team do marketing mechanics for users. They are rapidly increase user&rsquo;s loyalty and make a large profit.</p><p>In Ozon I learned a lot about large scale high availability architectures,
and implemented some of the mechanics as a bunch of microservices connected with Kafka,
using PostgreSQL as persistence storage and Redis as a cache.</p><p>Outside of work I like to dig into the open source and Linux systems (by the way I use Arch),
active Vim user, write personal wikipedia for knowledge management and participate in tech online forums.
To sum up, I&rsquo;m looking for more tech or infrastructure domain and may be it&rsquo;s your company!</p><h2 id=skills>Skills
