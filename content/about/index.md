I'm a software engineer at [ozon.ru](https://ozon.ru) in Moscow. Here I am working in a team as a Go backend engineer.<br>

My background is in computer science, I did my undergrad at Saint-Petersburg State University.
I did my [thesis](https://research.jetbrains.org/ru-ru/groups/ml_methods/seminars/120/) with [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) lab of AI tools for IntelliJ IDEA,
and at the same time, I worked in a few part-time jobs-startups.<br>

After the university, I wanted to develop highly distributed systems and joined a game [company](https://panoramikgames.com/) as a Python engineer.
I learned a lot about large scale systems, the infrastructure around them,
and played an important role in scaling core projects with increased business needs.<br>

This work showed me that I want to grow professionally as an infrastructure engineer and I need to move to a bigger company.<br>
Also because more infrastructure systems are written in Go and not Python, I changed the stack and was recruited to [ozon.ru](https://ozon.ru).<br>
It's an E-commerce online shop where we as a team do marketing mechanics for users. They are rapidly increase user's loyalty and make a large profit.<br>

In Ozon I learned a lot about large scale high availability architectures,
and implemented some of the mechanics as a bunch of microservices connected with Kafka,
using PostgreSQL as persistence storage and Redis as a cache.<br>

Outside of work I like to dig into the open source and Linux systems (by the way I use Arch),
active Vim user, write personal wikipedia for knowledge management and participate in tech online forums.<br>
To sum up, I'm looking for more tech or infrastructure domain and may be it's your company!<br>

## Skills
